# Pre-Reg-project
## An automatic compiler to create pre registrations at AADDO workplace

This was a project at my workplace that is created and owned by Vincent Lynch.

To setup, either create the an executable file using PyInstaller, or run it in the directory.

API key is hardcoded, but added a feature to find and select your json key to look for the google sheet.

Select which Google Sheet it is attached to, enter the title when asked.

Select the template in which you would like to edit. This is hardcoded, have the info of the cells chosen before running.

Finally, create a new excel document to save your progress
